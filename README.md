# Regression
Two-factor regression from an Excel document
Add three columns to the first sheet of your excel document. The first column is the required value, the second is the first factor and the third column is the second factor. Then select it from the application and it will add the coefficients of a two-factor polynomial of the second or third degree to the next column.
